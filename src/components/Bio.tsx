      <p className="mb-4">
        Hi, I&lsquo;m Full Stack Developer who loves building things that work well and make life easier. I&lsquo;ve spent years turning ideas into reliable,
        thoughtful software, always with a focus on clean code, clear goals, and real-world impact. I enjoy working on projects where I can simplify complexity
        and bring a calm, practical mindset to solving tough problems.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        I&lsquo;m most at home working across the stack with tools like Node.js, TypeScript, React, and PHP, often in cloud environments like AWS. Beyond the
        code, I care about good communication, collaboration, and keeping things humanâ€”even in tech. Whether I&lsquo;m refining a backend system or improving a
        user experience, I aim to build software that&lsquo;s not just functional, but genuinely useful.
